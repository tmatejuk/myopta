This is code I created as exercises and homeworks when I read book 'Make Your Own Python Text Adventure' by Phillip Johnson (Apress, 2018).

Mentioned book page : [Make Your Own Python Text Adventure. A Guide to Learning Programming](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-3231-6)

This book code is available at : [Apress/make-your-own-python-text-adventure](https://github.com/apress/make-your-own-python-text-adventure)
